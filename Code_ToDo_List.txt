the glider will continualy restart if the IMU or barometer don't respond, do we want some way to stop the glider from restarting after some number of restarts
DONE - convert long lat to feet
DONE - translate ellipse or translate the xy coordinates
DONE - convert the ellipse program to use an array of floats/doubles (2d?)
	DID (less memory used, faster access time) - If 1d array, functions to return x and y of value (points[0] == x0, points[1] == y0, points[2] == x1, points[3] == y1 (something like that))
function to decrease a while under 500/1000 feet
test for altitude every n seconds and report if under 500/1000 feet
add a reset pin and code to reset
add humidity sensor (or whatever the one jeff wanted to add)
	add print statement in printAllSensors
add ellipse program to arduino
